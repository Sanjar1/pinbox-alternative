# TODO

**Updated:** 2026-02-28

## 2GIS Execution (2026-02-28)

- [x] Normalize active branch names in 2GIS to `Сырная Лавка` (without additions) via `PUT /api/1.0/branches/{branchId}`.
- [x] Apply confirmed hour fixes in 2GIS:
  - row `14` / branch `70000001094396147`: `08:00-20:00` -> `08:00-22:00`
  - row `18` / branch `70000001053172745`: `08:00-20:00` -> `08:00-19:00`
- [x] Rebuild `2gis` sheet in `data/stores_audit.xlsx` after updates.
- [x] Save execution artifact: `data/2gis_applied_updates_2026-02-28.json`.
- [ ] Remove technical pending branch `branch_69a09623d9e3f` (`TEST`) in 2GIS cabinet when moderation UI allows removal.
- [ ] Complete moderation follow-up for pending `branch_*` cards and then re-run `2gis` sheet rebuild.

## Google Maps Closure Sprint (2026-02-27)

- [x] Refresh `google map` sheet in `data/stores_audit.xlsx` from current ownership data.
- [x] Add missing managed mappings for rows `5` and `20` in `scripts/build_google_sheet_from_current.py`.
- [~] Google coverage now: managed rows `5, 8, 15, 20, 25, 28`; waiting non-RUBA rows reduced to `24` (+ covered-candidate rows `2`, `12`).
- [x] Completed Google row-by-row first-pass sweep across all `35` rows; each row now has a latest attempt result in `data/google_claim_attempts_2026-02-27.json`.
- [~] Google creation fallback started for `not_found_search` rows (`4, 6, 29`): prepared import files, but Google Business import UI is currently blocked in this session context.
- [~] Google direct creation fallback (`Add single business` + `/create`) is currently blocked by forced redirect to Google policy/help page for missing rows `4, 6, 8, 26, 29, 34, 35`.
- [ ] Complete Google closure plan in `docs/plans/2026-02-27-google-maps-closure-plan.md`.
- [ ] Execute row-by-row checklist in `docs/GOOGLE_MAPS_TODO_2026-02-27.md`.
- [x] Rebuild `2gis` sheet and add compliant review workflow columns: `Reviews Action (Real only)` and `Review Note`.
- [x] Create combined execution runbook: `docs/plans/2026-02-27-google-2gis-execution-plan.md`.
- [x] Compliance note applied: no fake 5-star posting; use only genuine customer-review requests in 2GIS workflow.

## Operational Answers (2026-02-27)

- [~] 2GIS status answer: public customer phone is still mostly **+998977111515** (26 published branches), while **+998785551515** is present only on 1 branch; **+998935496767** is not published on branches.
- [ ] 2GIS required fix: set customer-facing phone to **+998785551515** on all published branches (where branch is active).
- [ ] 2GIS account verification phone check: confirm in 2GIS cabinet security/profile settings that SMS verification phone is **+998935496767** (not available via public/catalog API).
- [ ] 2GIS business description: copy approved Russian store description from Yandex and apply to all relevant 2GIS branches.
- [~] Project search for ready Russian description text: checked repo + local DB on 2026-02-27, no ready RU text found (need source text from user or Yandex export).
- [~] Google Maps contact audit: found 10 relevant cards for "РЎС‹СЂРЅР°СЏ Р›Р°РІРєР°/РЎС‹СЂРЅС‹Р№ Р±СѓС‚РёРє"; phones detected, no public emails detected.
- [x] Google Business check (sismatullaev@gmail.com): account currently has **7** managed locations (2 Verified, 5 Processing) as of 2026-02-27.
- [ ] Google ownership recovery: for each target store in Google Maps, run `Claim this business / Request access` from the same Google account.
- [ ] Google ownership recovery follow-up: track requests, wait response window, then escalate through Google Business appeal/support for no-response/denied requests.
- [ ] Google verification channels to use during claim flow: `+998977111515`, `+998935496767`, `+998785551515`, and `sanjar6767@gmail.com` (request code from user when prompted).
- [x] Create Excel sheet `google map` in `data/stores_audit.xlsx` with full store list and columns for `known from Google` vs `unknown / pending` (2026-02-27).
- [x] Approved RU business description (for profile fields): `Магазин качественных сыров и молочных продуктов. Широкий выбор отечественных и импортных сортов. Свежая продукция каждый день.`
- [~] Google ownership coverage now: `7` managed profiles mapped to `6` non-RUBA rows in Excel, plus `2` covered-candidate rows (`2`, `12`); `24` non-RUBA rows still need claim flow.
- [ ] Batch execution confirmed by owner: continue claiming remaining `24` non-RUBA locations and request verification codes from user when prompted.
- [~] Google claim blockers recorded: row `1` (`76G3+Q3P`) and row `18` (`88WW+Q56`) fail address validation; row `19` (`Газалкент`) not found in Maps search.
- [~] Additional Google search blockers recorded: row `4` (`Сакичмон 1`), row `6` (`Паркент 74`), row `29` (`Навруз 7`) return only already-known cards in Maps search.
- [~] Additional Google ownership blockers recorded: row `7` candidate (`Cheese Shop at Buz Bazar`, phone `+998935496767`) has no visible `Claim/Manage` CTA for current account; row `16` query resolves to generic `Farkhad Bazaar` card (needs exact store pin/link).
- [~] New claim blockers (2026-02-27): row `19` (`Syrnaya Lavka Yalangoch`, `88WW+Q56`) and row `33` (`Syrnaya Lavka`, `9QRQ+G9M`) reach claim wizard but fail on contact step with Google `RpcError` (`Sorry, try again later`).
- [~] New redirect blockers (2026-02-27): rows `13` (`Syrnaya Lavka Sergeli`, `66H9+352`) and `32` (`Syrnaya Lavka`, `9QRQ+G9M`) show `Claim this business` but redirect to Google policy/help page instead of claim wizard.
- [~] Candidate requiring owner confirmation: row `10` found `Syrnyy Butik` (`76V6+5WX`, `+998909266856`) with brand/phone mismatch vs baseline.

## Yandex Tracking Sync (2026-02-28)
